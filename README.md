### What is this repository for? ###

* This is a private repository of appply.me 
* Version alpha


### How do I get set up? ###

First you need to install vagrant(http://vagrantup.com). I recommend you to read the documentation..

On linux:
**$ vagrant up**
On Windows:
Don't use windows :p google --> update me 

Edit your host file:
linux /etc/hosts
windows: system32/etc/drivers/hosts i think

add this line 
192.168.56.101		appply.dev

So you can just type www.appply.dev in your webbrowser to visit your local development server
